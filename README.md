# Angular Express Seed

Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Express with EJS + Node on the back. This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use Node to serve their app.

The seed contains angular libraries and a bunch of scripts all pre-configured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball) and
you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.
It also illustrates writing angular views with EJS and how partials can be served by Express as static files.

## How to use angular-express-seed

Clone the angular-express-seed repository, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies, and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js

### Receiving updates from upstream

Just fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
